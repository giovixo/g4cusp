news:
- material in each part of the step file:
	- G4_Galactic: World
	- G4_Al: metallic frame; if_platform_payload; spacer; absorber_filter_al; scatterer_filter_al; column
	- G4_Glass_Plate: MAPMT -> convert with G4_Al but 90% density less 
	- G4_Plexiglass: scintillator_frame
	- G4_Teflon: wrapping
	- G4_W: Absorber_filter_W; absorber_Collimator; scatterer_Collimator
	- G4_PolytrifluoroChloroethylene: PCB; apd_sensor_pcb; apd; apd_pcb -> you have to convert that in FR4
	- G4_Plastic_SC_Vinyltoluene: Scatterer
	- G4_Ti: Aborber_filter_Ti; scatterer_filter_Ti
	- G4_A-150_TISSUE: Absorber -> look the material missing note

- material missing:
	- Absorber: custom material "GaGG" is not included in the NIST library, it shall be added manually in the simulator with this properties:
		GAGG: gadolinium-aluminium-gallium, 4 chemical elements Gd3Al2Ga3O12.density 6.63 g/cm3

- the mechanics have undergone significant changes:
	- 4 pcb have been positioned in another sector of the spacecraft
	- all structural parts have been modified
	- filters and collimators have been modeled with greater precision
	- the absorber and scatterer boxes changed with 64 scatterers + wrapping and 32 absorbers + wrapping
	- collimators have been modelled with the updated geometry (grid)
	- 100 micron of W around payload is missing

- naming: following label has been placed:
	- CUSP_GEANT4_Model_20240502-solids.xml
	- CUSP_GEANT4_Model_20240502.gdml
	- CUSP_GEANT4_Model_20240502-structure.xml

- The reference system and coordinates agree with the geometric model
