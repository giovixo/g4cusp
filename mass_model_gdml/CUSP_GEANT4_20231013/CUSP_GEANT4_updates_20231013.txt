news:
- material in each part of the step file:
	- G4_Galactic: World
	- G4_Al: metallic frame; if_platform_payload; spacer; absorber_filter_al; scatterer_filter_al
	- G4_Glass_Plate: MAPMT
	- G4_Plexiglass: Gyroscope; abs_scatt_frame
	- G4_W: short_side_W_cover; side_W_cover; Absorber_filter_W
	- G4_W: absorber_collimator; scatterer_collimator -> in this case the W is the material but you have to reduce the density of these parts of 90%
	- G4_PolytrifluoroChloroethylene: PCB; apd_sensor_pcb; apd; apd_pcb -> you have to convert that in FR4
	- G4_Plastic_SC_Vinyltoluene: Scatterer_box
	- G4_Ti: Aborber_filter_Ti; scatterer_filter_Ti
	- G4_A-150_TISSUE: Absorber_box -> look the material missing note

- material missing:
	- Absorber: custom material "GaGG" is not included in the NIST library, it shall be added manually in the simulator with this properties:
		GAGG: gadolinium-aluminium-gallium, 4 chemical elements Gd3Al2Ga3O12.density 6.63 g/cm3

- the mechanics have undergone significant changes:
	- gyroscope and 4 pcb have been positioned in another sector of the spacecraft
	- all structural parts have been modified
	- filters and collimators have been modeled with greater precision
	- the dimensions of the absorber and scatterer boxes are correct

- naming: following label has been placed:
	- cusp_payload_GEANT4-worldVOL-solids.xml
	- cusp_payload_GEANT4-worldVOL.gdml
	- cusp_payload_GEANT4-worldVOL-structure.xml
